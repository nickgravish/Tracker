Tracker.py will track all videos and return list of feature objects in each frame

Kalman.py will take in results from Tracker.py and will do data association to return list of trajectories observed.
Will only work on 2D images for right now. Based loosely on floris vb's code.

In Associator loop

1. From objects that are currently being tracked, update kalman filter prediction for each object.
2. Do data association based on the error estimates from the kalman filter
